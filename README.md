# Code Editor

This is a fully interactive online coding platform that allows users to solve algorithmic problems in a clean, intuitive interface—inspired by platforms like LeetCode. It’s designed to simulate a real coding environment for practice, testing, and problem-solving.

### 🔹 Key Features:
#### 1. 🧠 Problem Navigation
- Users can browse through coding problems. On selecting a problem, they are redirected to the code editor workspace.

#### 2.📄 Split-Screen Layout

- Left Panel: Displays the problem details, including description, constraints, examples, and tabs for Submissions and Solutions.

- Right Panel: A powerful code editor where users can write and edit their solutions.

#### 3. 💻 Code Execution Panel
- At the bottom of the editor, users can run their code and see test case results immediately—similar to how LeetCode or HackerRank work.

#### 4. 🔄 Previous & Next Navigation
- Supports switching between problems using "Prev" and "Next" buttons, making it easy to go through a list of questions without leaving the editor.

#### 5. ⚙️ Real-Time Interaction
- Fast and responsive interface ensures a smooth experience for both beginners and advanced users.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (Expected)
- React.js for frontend UI
- TypeScript for Type Safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- JSON for question data (can be replaced with API later)
- CodeMirror or similar for code editing features
